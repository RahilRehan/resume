I am thrilled to hear of Alpaca's available Software Engineer position, and I formally submit my resume for consideration.
I've recently learnt about algorithmic trading and was interested to know how different software companies are approaching this problem.
And I love that Alpaca is doing - making stock trading commission free!
Iâ€™m sure you receive many candidates for open positions, so allow me to present a few reasons why you should consider me.

I am a passionate Software Engineer with experience in Backend development. I have been working with Thoughtworks and my role there correlates with this position.
Me and my team are part of creating best practice starter kits for all the Thoughtworks projects, to jump start development.
This project required me to adhere to microservice architecture, DDD, SOA, TDD, 12-factor, SOLID principles.
I have contributed in Golang, Java and NodeJS starters.
As we were creating start-kits, every piece of code had to adhere to industry best practices, And I have learned a lot along the way.
On my journey, I have learnt the importance of OpenSource development and I'm exploring and trying to contribute to the community.

I think I fit the requirements of the ideal candidate pretty well. And my consulting, analytical and team building experience from Thoughtworks is a must mention.
So I believe this would be a good fit. I look forward to talking more about this exciting opportunity.
